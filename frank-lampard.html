The test was conducted by a Chelsea club doctor to research the impact of head injuries on footballers’ neurological development. Only 0.1 percent of the world population manages to record scores above 150.</li><li>For his immense contribution to the game, he was awarded an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) on June 13, 2015, during Queen’s birthday honors.</li><li>Once&nbsp;he was docked by the club along with his three teammates&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>John Terry</a>, Jody Morris and Eidur Gudjohnsen&nbsp;for disgraceful behavior after a drunken binge on September 12, 2001. They were found guilty of shouting abuses at the American passengers at the Heathrow Airport just 24 hours after the terrorist attack on World Trade Center.</li><li>In 2000, he was caught on tape along with fellow players <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Rio Ferdinand</a> and Kieron Dyer having s^x with a blonde at the holiday resort of Ayia Napa in Cyprus. The video footage was later used by the Channel to create a documentary titled S^x, Footballers and Videotape.</li><li>During the 2010 FIFA World Cup, in a round of 16-match against Germany, his long-range shot in the first half crashed off the underside of the goal post and clearly cleared the line before bouncing out. However, the goal wasn’t given and England eventually lost by 4-1.</li><li>Lampard was also embroiled in a heated argument with his West Ham United teammate Paolo Di Canio over who would take a penalty in a home match against Bradford at Upton Park in February 2000. West Ham was trailing 2-4 at that point. Lampard was the designated penalty taker for the team, however, Paolo wanted to take the penalty himself. In the end, Paolo prevailed and he went on to bury his penalty to make the score 4-3 in favor of Bradford. The match finished 5-4 in the end.</li><li>During the 2010 World Cup, he also achieved another unwanted record by attempting 37 shots on goal during the whole tournament without scoring a single goal. This was the highest number of shots on target since the 1966 World Cup without a single goal.</li><li>Frank&nbsp;is one of the 9&nbsp;players to play more than 100 games for the national team of England and has played in three World Cups and two Euro tournaments for the three lions until late 2016.</li><li>Although most football players harbor ambitions of becoming managers, Frank is a bit different in that aspect. He has expressed his ambition to compete in the infamous Ironman triathlon which&nbsp;is one of the most challenging competitions.</li><li>Lampard has also tasted success in the writing business. His children’s books, which have been published as part of Frankie’s Magic Football series by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers have been a decent success. The books revolve around the adventures of Frankie, his naughty older brother Kevin and his friends. Frank has revealed that his objective behind writing children’s books is that he wants his two daughters to know the necessity of reading from a young age.</li><li>Apart from holding the record of being the highest goal-scoring midfielder in English Premier League with 161 goals, he has the second-highest number of assists in the league after <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Ryan Giggs</a>. Ryan has 162 assists to his name in the league and Frank has recorded 102, as of October 2016.</li><li>Frank&nbsp;also holds the record for making the most number of Premier League appearances without missing a match. He played 164 consecutive matches before sitting out of the match against Manchester City on December 28, 2005, due to illness.</li><li>For his tremendous performances over the years, he has won a number of high-profile awards including Premier League Player of the Season for two consecutive seasons – 2004/2005 and 2005/2006. He also finished runner-up behind <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Ronaldinho</a> for the FIFA Player of the Year award in 2005.</li><li>Visit his official website @&nbsp;www.frankiesmagicfootball.co.uk.</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jp%2BpmqabYrmiuc%2BaqZ1n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./henry-ford-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Henry Ford Net Worth">&larr;
