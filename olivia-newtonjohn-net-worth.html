Olivia Newton-John died on August 8, 2022, at the age of 73. She had been battling cancer on-and-off for many years.</p><p>Olivia Newton-John enjoyed both a successful recording career and film career. With record sales of an estimated 120 million, Olivia was one of the best-selling artists in history. She released more than 25 studio albums and was known for singles like "Physical," "I Honestly Love You," and "Have You Never Been Mellow."</p><p>Newton-John's most notable film role is Sandy Olsson in the 1978 musical "Grease," and she also appeared in the films "Xanadu" (1979), "Sordid Lives" (2000), and "The Very Excellent Mr. Dundee" (2020) and the television shows "Sordid Lives: The Series" (2008) and "Glee" (2010). Olivia produced the 2001 television film "The Wilde Girls" and the 2009 documentary "Big River Man," and she published the books "Livwise Cookbook: Easy, Well-Balanced, and Delicious Recipes for a Healthy, Happy Life" (2011) and "Don't Stop Believin'" (2018). Newton-John was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1979 and a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 2020.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Olivia Newton-John was born on September 26, 1948, in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England. Olivia grew up with mother Irene, father Brinley, and older siblings Hugh and Rona; Rona was married to Olivia's "Grease" co-star <a href=# title="Jeff Conaway Net Worth">Jeff Conaway</a> in the early '80s. Brinley was an MI5 officer who was involved in the Enigma project during World War II, and he later served as the Headmaster of the Cambridgeshire High School for Boys. Newton-John's maternal grandfather was Max Born, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who fled Germany for Britain in order to escape the Nazis. When Olivia was 6 years old, the family moved to Melbourne, Australia, where her father took a job at Ormond College at the University of Melbourne. Newton-John attended Christ Church Grammar School and University High School.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>At age 14, Olivia and three of her classmates formed the band Sol Four. The all-girl group often performed at her brother-in-law's coffee shop, and she was regularly featured on local TV and radio shows. While appearing on "The Go!! Show," she met Pat Carroll and John Farrar, who would become her duet partner and producer, respectively. Newton-John won a talent contest on "Sing, Sing, Sing," receiving the prize of a trip to Great Britain, which she took a year later. She made her film debit in 1965's "Funny Things Happen Down Under," and in 1966, she recorded "Till You Say You'll Be Mine," her first single. She later formed the duo Pat and Olivia with Pat Carroll, and after Carroll moved back to Australia after her visa expired, Newton-John focused on solo work until 1975 when she joined the group Toomorrow. With the band, she starred in the 1970 film "Toomorrow" and released the singles "I Could Never Live Without Your Love"/"Roll Like a River" and "You're My Baby Now"/"Goin' Back." Olivia released her debut solo album, "If Not for You," on November 1, 1971, and it was certified Platinum in Australia. Her third album, 1973's "Let Me Be There," earned Newton-John her first Grammy as well as an Academy of Country Music award. In 1974, she was chosen to represent the U.K. in the Eurovision Song Contest and finished in fourth place.</p><p>Olivia's 1974 single "I Honestly Love You" topped the charts in Australia, Canada, and the U.S., and her starring turn in 1978's "Grease" brought her three more hit singles, "You're the One That I Want," "Summer Nights," and "Hopelessly Devoted to You." The film was a massive success, grossing $366.2 million at the box office, and Newton-John followed it up by starring as Kira in 1979's "Xanadu." In 1981, she released the album "Physical," which went 2× Platinum in the U.S. and 4× Platinum in Canada; the title track reached #1 in several countries. Olivia hosted "Saturday Night Live" in 1982 and appeared in the film "Two of a Kind" in 1983, and she starred in two HBO specials, "Olivia in Concert" (1982) and "Olivia Down Under" (1988). She appeared in the television films "A Mom for Christmas" (1990) and "A Christmas Romance" (1994), and she hosted the series "Timeless Tales from Hallmark" in 1990. Her 1994 album, "Gaia: One Woman's Journey," chronicled Newton-John's first battle with breast cancer, and unlike her previous albums, she wrote all the lyrics and music herself. In 1995, Olivia guest-starred on "The Man from Snowy River" and "Ned and Stacey," followed by "Tracey Takes On…" and "Murphy Brown" in 1997.
