We uncovered the latest on the whereabouts of this TV icon.</strong></p><p>Bob Barker is a celebrated American TV personality who hosted “The Price Is Right.” Here is everything to know about the 19-time Emmy winner’s current status.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Bob_Barker></span>Who Is Bob Barker?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Retired American television game show host<a href=#> Robert William Barker</a> is one of the most decorated Hollywood stars alive. He was born on December 12, 1923. He was widely known for hosting CBS’s “The Price Is Right” from 1972 to 2007. This made him a familiar face to millions of viewers for decades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/young-bob.jpg><p>Before becoming a beloved host, Barker’s journey began with humble beginnings that shaped his career trajectory. Barker spent most of his youth on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in Mission, South Dakota. He attended Drury College in Springfield, Missouri.&nbsp;</p><p>He joined the United States Navy Reserve in 1943 during World War II to train as a fighter pilot but did not serve on active duty. During leave from the military, he returned to the US and married his childhood sweetheart, Dorothy Jo, on January 12, 1945.&nbsp;After the war, he returned to Drury to finish his education, graduating with a degree in economics.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bob_Barkers_Career></span>Bob Barker’s Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After finishing his education, Barker focused on a radio career, eventually working at a station in California. This was where he caught the attention of Ralph Edwards, the creator of “Truth or Consequences,” a popular television game show in which contestants who failed to answer trivia questions correctly had to perform stunts.&nbsp;</p><p>Barker signed a deal with Edwards and began hosting the program in 1956, and his pleasant manner quickly connected with audiences. He remained with the show until 1975. While on “Truth or Consequences,” Barker also hosted several short-lived game shows.</p><p>Barker continued to host “The Price Is Right” until he retired from the show in 2007. Drew Carey succeeded him. In the following years, Barker made a lot of film and TV appearances, such as “Happy Gilmore” and “WWE Raw.”</p><p>His career has garnered numerous awards, including 19 Emmys and several honors, such as a Hollywood Walk of Fame star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/emmys-bob.jpg><p>Barker has been a <a href=#>celebrity vegetarian</a> for over three decades of his life. He has also been a strong advocate for aminal rights over the years. He has participated in several PETA public service announcements as well. On April 6, 2009, former Los Angeles Times book review editor Digby Diehl wrote and published Barker’s autobiography, “Priceless Memories.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Bob_Barker_Still_Alive></span>Is Bob Barker Still Alive?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, Bob Barker is still alive. Although his health has made a lot of headlines over the years, the retired star is still active. Over the years, he has had significant health scares that have made people wonder how he is doing healthwise.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1999, a diagnosis revealed a partially blocked left carotid artery after he noticed some clumsiness in his right hand. This was while preparing for a presentation to testify before a Congress in Washington, DC, regarding animal rights.</p><p>He sought medical treatment and underwent a carotid endarterectomy to remove the blockage. The procedure was successful, and he could return to work within the month.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bob-old.jpg><p>In 2002, Barker had two additional health crises after taping the 30th-season finale of “The Price is Right.” On May 30, he suffered a stroke while lying in the sun. He was hospitalized and had to undergo surgery again. Just six weeks later, on July 11, Barker underwent prostate surgery. Both hospitalizations occurred at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, DC, and both surgeries were successful.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to his frequent tanning, Barker also had several mild bouts of skin cancer. Thankfully, the cancers did not threaten his life, as he consulted a dermatologist regularly to ensure they caught and removed any cancers before they could spread. He also urged viewers to see dermatologists periodically and pay attention to their skin health.&nbsp;</p><p>On October 20, 2015, two police officers saw Barker trip and fall on a sidewalk while passing by his home in Los Angeles. They called an ambulance that took him to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He hurt his knee and forehead and had to receive stitches. He sustained minor injuries and was released later on the same day.</p><p>Older people are prone to frequent falls, and Barker slipped and hit his head again at home on June 19, 2017. His maid drove him to the emergency room, where they checked and released him. This fall was reportedly less severe than his earlier fall in 2015.</p><p>In 2018, Barker was rushed to the hospital for severe back pain. It was later reported to be a complication from his previous falls.</p><p>Although he has had many health issues over the years, Bob Barker has managed to defeat all odds and has lived for almost a century. Fans are eagerly waiting to celebrate his 100th birthday in December 2023.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR5waiZZpqRp7imvoysq6KknGKurbXVnmSerpWnxrW0yKeeZpmSpMK1eceiqmabpae%2FprrTZqqtmaSqwHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./richest-celebrities.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Yo-Yo Ma Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
