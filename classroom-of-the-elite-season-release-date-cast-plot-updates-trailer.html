One of the best anime series among the audience is supposed to come back with the new volumes of the Japanese light novel “<strong>Manga</strong>”.&nbsp;</p><p id=block-68181c51-0d98-4ff4-82f5-6200bc44c8ef>If you don’t know about the “Classroom of the Elite,” let us take a quick look here. “Classroom of the Elite” is inspired by a Japanese light novel pen down by Shogo Kinugasa and illustrated by Shunsaku Tomas. It also got featured in a <a href=#>manga series</a> called out under the direction of Youkoso Jitsuryoku in January 2016. It received so much fanbase due to its electrifying storyline. Later, three Manga volumes were selected for the “Classroom of the Elite” season 1, consisting of 12 episodes. Season 1 streamed on the 12th of July 2017 and run-up to September 2017. One of the best reasons which make it worth watching is to revive your dream school life and how your life takes a turn if you accompany your right people and beloved real friends. By resisting the conventional way to look at things from a very different approach and perspective about your life, this anime series pours out it in a very bondable way for its audience. The protagonist of the series, named Kiyotaka Ayanokoji, showed up as a shy underconfident student of the D-class of the school. But the way he promotes himself in A-class after being friends with his two classmates seems worthwhile to watch.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-446b818a-dae6-4845-82bb-37674f138a8f>Is the Animated series renewed for Season 3?</h2><p id=block-fa755c4c-0f4c-413e-9cc3-a6f6f70b835b>The animation studio has recently revealed the third season of Classroom of the Elite.

Let us tell you that the creators of the series Youkoso Jitsuryoku and the producers, Lerche Studio, are still silent about the renewal and cancelation of season 2. But the high demand from its strong fanbase emphasizes the creator to bring out its second season!</p><p id=block-3bfb006f-84c3-43ba-bcdb-7c9789a401ae>If the renewal is possible, there’s an expectation that the show will be released in January 2024.
