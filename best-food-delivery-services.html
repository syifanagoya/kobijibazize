Wrapping things up takes patience and a lot of work, which means we have a little less time on our hands to cook new meals. Sure, <a href=# rel=noopener>ordering takeout or prepared meals</a>&nbsp;via Postmates or Uber Eats is always a reasonably solid option, but if you’re like me and have realized that the majority of the money you’ve shelled out during the pandemic has literally gone directly to the pricey contactless restaurant and lazy-day fast <a href=# id=auto-tag_food data-tag=food>food</a> orders, you may also be looking to pull back a bit on relying on these <a href=# id=auto-tag_delivery data-tag=delivery>delivery</a> apps to feed you, whether because you’re looking to save money or just trying to get back on track with healthier eating habits.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anua-cleansing-oil-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><p>While many of us are familiar with some of the <a href=# rel=noopener>O.G. meal prep delivery</a> and subscription services like Blue Apron, there are plenty of newer and more under-the-radar options that also deliver ready-to-cook and perfectly portioned ingredients that won’t put such a dent in your wallet and will help you get back in the kitchen. Sure, they may not be quite as budget-friendly as shopping for your own groceries, but they’re ridiculously convenient nonetheless. And that’s worth every penny.</p><p>Plus, these services are the perfect option for beginner chefs like me that want to dabble in the “culinary arts”, but still <a href=# rel=noopener>need just a little more help in the kitchen</a> than the average person (hey, at least I’ve graduated from microwavable burritos, y’all!).
